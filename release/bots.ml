Initial move: stone and wheat
and make cities as quick as possible
and trade stone and wheat to other people
because once you make a settlement, super easy to turn'em into cities
go for largest army too
if resources to kill, get dev cards
if high threat player, don't trade
if low threat player, help them.
Using priority queue to rank the shit you want the bot to do. *)
